        <p>Hi, I'm Diya Patel. I’m a Computer Engineer with a strong focus on Embedded Systems, Hardware and System Design, and system architecture. I enjoy working with hardware architectures, designing efficient digital systems, and developing embedded solutions that seamlessly connect hardware with software.</p>
        <p>I work with C, which aligns well with embedded development and system-level engineering. My goal is to design systems that are precise, scalable, and performance-driven.</p>
        <p>Outside of engineering, I stay active, explore new technologies, and take on projects that push my skills further. Feel free to connect with me!</p>
