                <p> Overview/Summary:
                    
                    This is a simple but fully functional web app that tracks real-time stock prices and related news. I built it from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî no frameworks, no libraries. You type in a stock ticker like ‚ÄúAAPL‚Äù or ‚ÄúTSLA,‚Äù and it instantly shows the current price, daily change, and some news articles related to that stock.
                    Process & Methodology:

                    Process & Methodology:
                    I broke the project down into small parts:
                    -First, I designed a basic layout using HTML and CSS.
                    -Then I added JavaScript functions for handling input, fetching stock data, and updating the page.
                    -I used modular code structure with separate functions for fetching data, rendering components, and formatting numbers.
                    -Everything was tested live in the browser, with manual debugging and console.log() spam until things worked.
                    -Version control was handled with Git, and I kept things iterative ‚Äî build, test, fix, repeat.

                    Key Features/Deliverables:
                    -üîç Search bar to look up any stock symbol
                    -üìà Live stock data: current price, open/close, volume, change %
                    -üì∞ Related financial news headlines displayed right on the page
                    -üì± Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop
                    -‚ùå Error handling for invalid symbols, slow network, or no results
                  

                    Results & Achievements:
                    -Stock data loads in under 2 seconds for valid symbols
                    -Cleaned up and formatted API responses for better UX
                    -Modular structure makes it easy to add more features (e.g., graphs or dark mode)
                    -Works 100% in-browser ‚Äî no backend required
                    -Gained full control over how data is handled, displayed, and debugged

                    Learnings & Growth:
                    -Got better at working with asynchronous JavaScript (async/await, fetch)
                    -Learned how to structure vanilla JS code in a clean, readable way
                    -Practiced responsive web design using CSS Flexbox and media queries
                    -Improved at debugging network-based bugs and edge cases
                    -Built confidence working without frameworks or templates
